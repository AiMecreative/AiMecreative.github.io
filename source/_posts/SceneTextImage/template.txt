- **Motivations**
  - previous representation learning methods use tightly coupled features for all tasks, resulting in sub-optimal performance
  - disentangling these two types (style feature and context feature) of features for improved adaptability in better addressing various downstream tasks
- **Methods**
  - <u>Dataset</u>: we synthesize a dataset of image pairs with identical style but different content
  - <u>Losses</u>: content features are supervised by a text recognition loss, while an alignment loss aligns the style features in the image pairs

To illustrate the drawbacks of using tightly coupled features.

- STR with segementation preprocessing
  - [SIGA](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Guan_Self-Supervised_Implicit_Glyph_Attention_for_Text_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)
  - [CCD](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Guan_Self-Supervised_Character-to-Character_Distillation_for_Text_Recognition_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)
  - [Deformable CNN](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/138020203) use a learnable bias in convolution block to represent deformations

> **Attention**
> - This model divides style and context fetures with the SAME lengths, which may constrain the ability to represent background information, because the background is assumed more complex than texts.
