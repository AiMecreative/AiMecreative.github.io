# Introduction
## The Three Idea of AI
**Symbolicism**: mathematical logical, <font color=orange>reasoning is computation</font>.  
**Connectionism**: constructure defines the usage, association between a particular <font color=orange>stimulus</font> and a <font color=orange>response</font>.  
**Actionism**: cybernetics, trial and error, learning from <font color=orange>environment</font>.

## Main Concepts of RL
**RL**: Learning from interaction(feedback).  
**Agent**: goal-directed decision-maker.  
**Environment**: uncertain or has model.  
**Reward**: indicate what is good in an immediate sense.  
**Value**: indicate the long-term reward(cumulative reward).  
**Policy**: the way of agent's behavior.

*all goals can be described by the maximisation of expected cumulative reward*

Learning: find the **policy** to maximum value.
