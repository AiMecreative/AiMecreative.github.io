# Introduction
## What is Patter Recognition?
- Pattern
  - the opposite of choas
- Recognition
  - Identification of a pattern as  a member of a category
  - <font color=blue>Classification</font>: category known $\Rightarrow$ assign proper class label for each pattern
  - <font color=blue>Clustering</font>: category unknown $\Rightarrow$ learn categories and group patterns
- Pattern Recognition
  - Perceive (理解): interact with the real-world
  - Process (处理): learn to distinguish patterns of interest
  - Prediction (预测): make sound and reasonable decisions about the categories

## Process
$$

pre-procession \Leftrightarrow Feature\ Extraction \Leftrightarrow Classification

$$
$$

input \Rightarrow sensing \Leftrightarrow segmentation \Leftrightarrow Feature\ Extraction \Leftrightarrow classiffication \Leftrightarrow post-procession

$$

this is a <font color=blue>Feedback</font> progress.
