## Finished! My First Blog!
After a long time deploying my blog webpage and a lot of other borthering settings, I finally finished it! I mean, FINALLY!!! :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:

### Original Intention

Can a programmer has no personal blog? I have seen many blogers writing their own blogs no metter answering a question or just taking notes from time to time on websites such as [zhihu][1] and [csdn][2], but among which I prefer is to establish a personal website where I can put my blogs on.

[1]: https://zhihu.com
[2]: https://csdn.net

So, at first I have no intention about what to do with my site, maybe I just feel that it's really cool to have such a lovely home for oneself to "lie down and rest".

But when it was finally established by myself, experencing a lot of confusing problems and taking amount of time to debug, I must to say that, I love here, and I believe I will take after it like taking after a baby, a baby who are growing up. :blush:

### Thanks

I would not finish my work without the help of JerryYang, whose helpful blog is the guidance of mine (though there are still some mistakes maybe? :dizzy_face:). Based on it, I have known some basic command with Linux, Git and [Github][3], which is also beneficial for my lessons next term. Except him I want to link some videos there to thank for another ups from bilibili:
